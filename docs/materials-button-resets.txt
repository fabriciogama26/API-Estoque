Materiais Buttons Reset
=======================

Status/Context:
- `handleSubmit` (src/pages/Materiais.jsx) is now a stub that only prevents default submission, clears errors, and toggles `isSaving` without calling any backend service.
- `startEdit` in the same file is also an empty stub so the edit button no longer pre-populates or triggers logic.
- No “Salvar material”, “Salvar alterações” or history updates execute anywhere in the app while this reset is in place.
- Validation helpers (`validateMaterialForm`, payload builders) remain untouched and available for when the flows are rebuilt.

Touch points zeroed:
- `src/pages/Materiais.jsx`: reset submit handler + editor stub.
- `src/components/Materiais/MateriaisForm.jsx`: left buttons/UI intact but now no backend wiring occurs.
- `api/services/api.js`: no changes were made here during the reset, so the insert/update service remains ready for later reactivation.

Next steps:
- Reintroduce the desired flow once the cached `nome` value is understood and we are ready to call the sanitized backend again.
